# Pic2SpreadSheet

This little python program will turn your image files into a spreadsheet that represents the image you specified!

# Requirements

> [Python](https://www.python.org)
> [xlsxwriter](https://pypi.org/project/XlsxWriter/)
> [openpyxl](https://pypi.org/project/openpyxl/)


# How to

Run  ``python Pic2SpreadSheet.py``
Follow the commands in the console window.


# Note

**The program will be slow to process big images, the bigger the image the slower it will be. Also note that Excel isn't great at displaying a lot of information at once, so expect some lag there aswell.**
**The file you input is relative to the python file you execute**
